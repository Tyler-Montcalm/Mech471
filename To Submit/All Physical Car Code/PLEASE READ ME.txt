The following code is used for the physical car:

-joystick_example: Modified version of prof's code (see report and "Joystick_to_Arduino" for details of modification).
			Grabs data from Xbox controller and stores it in shared memory.
-Joystick_to_Arduino: Takes code from shared memory and feeds it to "Transmitter" via serial communication.
-Transmitter: Arduino code that processes data into complete, correct message (serial can get out of sync) and sends
		via radio the message to the "Controller".
Controller: The code used by the Arduino on the actual car.

Controller_Including_PID: This is the code we did not get to test due to time constraints that incorporates speed, traction and launch control onto the physical car

To know more about how these work, refer to the comments in the code (I put a lot of work into them) and the report.

To run, follow this procedure:

1. Have the Transmitter plugged into the computer.
2. Have "Joystick_to_Arduino" and "joystick_example" running (with the DirectX dialog as the active window). You will see the
	data from the joystick being printed back onto the command promt for "Joystick_to_Arduino".
3. Power up the car and wait 5 seconds (the car is programmed to wait 5 seconds before listening for signals).
