NRF24L01 Breakout Board Socket
==============================

This is a utility breakout board for connecting NRF24L01 with pinout of 2x4 pins modules. Sometime you need to do prototyping or testing on breadbord, and this board will exactly do this job perfectly!

this breakout have the following features: 

- 10uF Capacitor on VCC line (PTH or SMD)
- Power LED
- Nice pinout reading of exposed pins on PCB silk

If you follow me, you know that I like to use simple NRF24L01 pinout on all my projects, so this mean you can also use this breakout with the following other breakout for HopeRF modules such as:

- RFM12B or RFM69CW with SD and Flash EEP [Breakout Board][2]
- RFM69W with SD and Flash EEP [Breakout Board][3]
- RFM92 RFM95 RFM96 RFM98 Lora modules [Breakout Board][4]

Detailed Description
====================

Nothing fancy, just a matter of wiring, see schematics to view pins exposed.

You can order the PCB of this board [PCBs.io][6]. PCBs.io give me some reward when you order my designed boards from their site. This is pretty cool because I can use these rewards to order boards for a discounted price and share new designed boards project
